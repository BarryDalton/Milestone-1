# Scope

As part of the first milestone project students are tasked with creating a responsive website, that is mobile first and must contain a minimum of 3 pages. Which are a home page, about page and contact page to book the band for a gig or event.

# Requirements

 Build a website for a band (real or fictional)

 External userâ€™s goal:
	The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

## Site owner's goal:
	The band are interested in selling more of their music/merchandise and getting more gigs.
	
## Potential features to include:
	1. Showcase photos, audio and/or video clips from the band's catalog.
	Publicise the band's upcoming shows and/or availability to perform at events such as weddings and corporate parties.
	Provide links to external resources, such as the band's social media profiles (can point anywhere at all).


# Created using 
- HTML 
- CSS
 - BOOTSTRAP

# UX
The original design & concept was sketched out and then transferred to mockflow.com to refine the design, make any necessary changes.  The sketches have been added to the assets/mock up folder as well as the mockflow designs.

I decided to utilise a simple and clean layout and color scheme (whites & grey), using this color scheme allows for the webiste to be accessible for persons with color blindness, so staying away from reds/greens.
Fixed Navbar that is visible when scrolling and when resized is to a smaller display, it will reduce to a "hamburger icon"
