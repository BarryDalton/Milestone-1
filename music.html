				Funeral, 2004
			</h2>
			<p>
				Following an exhausting year, Arcade Fire decamped to a church outside of Montreal to work on a second release. 
                The ambitious Neon Bible arrived in March 2007, featuring such grand ornamentations as a pipe organ, a military choir, and a full orchestra. 
                The album peaked at number two and sparked another tour, which found the band playing more than 120 shows over the course of a year. 
                When touring wrapped up in early 2008, Arcade Fire played several shows in support of presidential candidate Barack Obama before beginning work on a third album. 
                The resulting The Suburbs, an eclectic 16-track ode to childhood, suburban sprawl, and middle-class dreams both won and lost, arrived on August 2, 2010. 
                The record was universally acclaimed and reached number one in both the U.S. and U.K. album charts. 
                The following year they won a host of awards, including prestigious accolades such as a Grammy for Album of the Year, the Polaris Prize, 
                and BRIT awards for both Best International Album and Group, among other honors and nominations.

			<h2>
				The Suburbs, 2010
			</h2>
			<p>
				Montreal's Arcade Fire successfully avoided the sophomore slump with 2007's apocalyptic Neon Bible. 
				Heavier and more uncertain than their nearly perfect, darkly optimistic 2004 debut, the album aimed for the nosebleed section and left a red mess. 
				Having already fled the cold comforts of suburbia on Funeral and suffered beneath the weight of the world on Neon Bible, 
				it seems fitting that a band once so consumed with spiritual and social middle-class fury should find peace "under the overpass in the parking lot." 
				If nostalgia is just pain recalled, repaired, and resold, then The Suburbs is its sales manual. Inspired by brothers Win and William Butler's 
				suburban Houston, Texas upbringing, the 16-track record plays out like a long lost summer weekend, with the jaunty but melancholy Kinks/Bowie-esque 
				title cut serving as its bookends. Meticulously paced and conservatively grand, fans looking for the instant gratification of past anthems like 
				"Wake Up" and "Intervention" will find themselves reluctantly defending The Suburbs upon first listen, but anyone who remembers excitedly jumping
				 into a friend's car on a sleepy Friday night armed with heartache, hope, and no agenda knows that patience is key. Multiple spins reveal a work 
				 that's as triumphant and soul-slamming as it is sentimental and mature. At its most spirited, like on "Empty Room," "Rococo," "City with No Children," 
				 "Half Light II (No Celebration)," "We Used to Wait," and the glorious Régine Chassagne-led "Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)," 
				 the latter of which threatens to break into Blondie's "Heart of Glass" at any moment, Arcade Fire make the suburbs feel positively electric. 
				 Quieter moments reveal a changing of the guard, as Win trades in the Springsteen-isms of Neon Bible for Neil Young on "Wasted Hours," 
				 and the ornate rage of Funeral for the simplicity of a line like "Let's go for a drive and see the town tonight/There's nothing to do, 
				 but I don't mind when I'm with you," from album highlight "Suburban War." The Suburbs feels like Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused for the Y 
				 generation. It's serious without being preachy, cynical without dissolving into apathy, 
				and whimsical enough to keep both sentiments in line, and of all of their records, it may be the one that ages the best.

					<h2>
				Reflektor, 2013
			</h2>
			<p>
				After stunning the mainstream pop machine into a state of huffy, new school e-disbelief by beating out Eminem, 
				Lady Antebellum, Lady Gaga, and Katy Perry for the 2011 Album of the year Grammy, Arcade Fire seemed poised for a 
				U2-style international coup, but the Suburbs, despite its stadium-ready sonic grandiosity, was far too homespun and idiosyncratic 
				to infect the masses in the same way as the Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby. Reflektor, the Montreal collective's much anticipated
				 fourth long-player and first double-album, moves the group even further from pop culture sanctification with a seismic yet
				  impenetrable 13-track set (at 75 minutes it’s one minute over standard single disc capacity) that guts the building but leaves
				   the roof intact. Going big was never going to be a problem, especially for a band so well-versed in the art of anthem husbandry, 
				   and they're still capable of shaking the rafters, as evidenced by the cool and circuitous, Roxy Music-forged, David Bowie-assisted
				    title cut, the lush, Regine Chassagne-led “It's Never Over (Oh Orpheus),” and the impossibly dense and meaty “We Exist,” 
					but what ultimately keeps Reflektor from sticking the landing is bloat. The stylistic shifts, courtesy of LCD Soundsystem's 
					James Murphy, aren’t nearly as jarring as the turgid and Tiki-colored, almost seven-minute “Here Comes the Night Time,” 
					the six minutes of rewinding tape that serve as the coda for the otherwise lovely “Supersymmetry,” or the unnecessarily drawn-out
					 fountain of white noise that should seamlessly connect the Gary Glittery “Joan of Arc” with the Flaming Lips-ian “Here Comes the
					  Night Time, Pt. 2,” but doesn’t because the songs are on separate discs. Flush with artistic capital, they went on a bender,
					   and in the process lost some of the warmth, jubilation, and capacity for empathy that made their first three efforts so inclusive.
					    Nevertheless, Reflektor is as fascinating as it is frustrating, an oddly compelling miasma of big pop moments and empty sonic
						 vistas that offers up a (full-size) snapshot of a band at its commerical peak, trying to establish eye contact from atop a mountain.

					The fact that Arcade Fire's fourth album, Reflektor, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart was no fluke. A captivating lead-up has been afoot for months,
