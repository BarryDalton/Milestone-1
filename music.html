				Funeral
			</h2>
			<p>
				Following an exhausting year, Arcade Fire decamped to a church outside of Montreal to work on a second release. 
                The ambitious Neon Bible arrived in March 2007, featuring such grand ornamentations as a pipe organ, a military choir, and a full orchestra. 
                The album peaked at number two and sparked another tour, which found the band playing more than 120 shows over the course of a year. 
                When touring wrapped up in early 2008, Arcade Fire played several shows in support of presidential candidate Barack Obama before beginning work on a third album. 
                The resulting The Suburbs, an eclectic 16-track ode to childhood, suburban sprawl, and middle-class dreams both won and lost, arrived on August 2, 2010. 
                The record was universally acclaimed and reached number one in both the U.S. and U.K. album charts. 
                The following year they won a host of awards, including prestigious accolades such as a Grammy for Album of the Year, the Polaris Prize, 
                and BRIT awards for both Best International Album and Group, among other honors and nominations.
